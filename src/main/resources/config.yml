  # ===== AUTOMATIC RESOURCE PACK DELIVERY =====

  # ===== SELF-HOSTING (EASIEST OPTION) =====
  # The plugin can host the resource pack directly from the Minecraft server
  # No external web server needed!
  self-host:
    # Enable built-in HTTP server for resource pack hosting
    # If enabled, the plugin will automatically serve the resource pack
    # and players will download it directly from the Minecraft server
    enabled: true

    # Port for the HTTP server
    # Make sure this port is open in your firewall
    # Common choices: 8080, 8888, 9000
    port: 8080

    # Address to bind to
    # "0.0.0.0" = accept connections from anywhere (recommended)
    #             The plugin will automatically use your server's IP for the client URL
    # "127.0.0.1" = only localhost (for testing single-player)
    # Your server IP = accept from that specific IP only
    address: "0.0.0.0"

  # ===== EXTERNAL HOSTING (OPTIONAL) =====
  # If self-hosting is disabled, you can specify an external URL
  # Examples:
  #   - HTTP: "http://yourserver.com/CharmedChars-ResourcePack.zip"
  #   - HTTPS: "https://yourserver.com/resourcepacks/CharmedChars-ResourcePack.zip"
  #   - File (local testing): "file:///C:/path/to/CharmedChars-ResourcePack.zip"
  #
  # Leave empty ("") to use self-hosting
  # Only used if self-host.enabled is false
  resource-pack-url: ""

  # Whether resource pack is required (kicks player if they decline)
  # Set to true to enforce resource pack usage
  # Set to false to make it optional
